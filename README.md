# graalpy-embedding
Experiments with GraalPy.

## Goal
I'd like to embed GraalPy into my Java Application which used to embed Jython so far. Since I am very new to GraalPy, I might do very stupid things. With the help of the GraalPy team, I hope to improve the embedding over time.

## Why issues?
The issues denote requirements I need to tackle, before being able to really migrate my application.
